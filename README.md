<h1>Pensioner Web Application</h1>

This is a web application built using MERN stack technology. The application helps pensioners in India to submit their life certificates and receive their pensions in their bank accounts. The application allows pensioners to register on the website using their email address, view their details on the home page, get a pop-up alert box if they have not submitted their life certificate, and upload their Aadhar number, photo, and signature as an image.

*The web application has the following features:*

- User Registration: Pensioners can register on the website using their email address.<br>

- Home Page: Pensioners can view their details on the home page.<br>

- Pop-up Alert Box: Pensioners receive a pop-up alert box if they have not submitted their life certificate.<br>

- Upload Page: Pensioners can upload their Aadhar number, photo, and signature as an image. The image is stored in the database.<br>

- Pension Service Centre: In case a pensioner is unable to upload a digital copy of their certificate, depending on their location, they can see the Pension Service Centre. They can go to the centre and submit their life certificate. The location is limited to State and District.<br>

- Grievance Registration: Pensioners can register their grievances through email.<br>

- Life Certificate Submission Pop-up: Depending on the current time of the year, pensioners receive a pop-up on the home page of their application, asking them to submit their life certificate. For example, if the current month is November, only family pensioners receive a notification for life certificate submission.<br>
